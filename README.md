# ABED-2-pop (Agent-Based Evolutionary Dynamics with 2 populations)
ABED-2-pop is a modeling framework designed to simulate the evolution of two populations of agents who play a 2-player game. Agents in one population play the game with agents in the other population. Every agent is occasionally given the opportunity to revise his strategy.
