# ABED-2pop (Agent-Based Evolutionary Dynamics in 2 populations)
ABED-2pop is a modeling framework designed to simulate the evolution of two populations of agents who play a 2-player game. Agents in one population play the game with agents in the other population. Every agent is occasionally given the opportunity to revise his strategy.

ABED-2pop is implemented in [NetLogo](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) and fully explained at [this website](https://luis-r-izquierdo.github.io/abed-2pop/).

You are most welcome to extend the model as you please, either privately or by creating a branch in this repository. If you’d like to see any specific feature implemented, but you don’t know how to go about it, do feel free to email us and we’ll do our best to make it happen.
