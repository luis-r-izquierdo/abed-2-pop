# ABED-2pop (Agent-Based Evolutionary Dynamics with 2 populations)
ABED-2pop is a modeling framework designed to simulate the evolution of two populations of agents who play a 2-player game. Agents in one population play the game with agents in the other population. Every agent is occasionally given the opportunity to revise his strategy.

ABED-2pop is implemented in [NetLogo](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) and fully explained at [this website](https://luis-r-izquierdo.github.io/abed-2pop/).
